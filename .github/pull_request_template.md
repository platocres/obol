## Live Integration Done Gate

Product Build Next work is not complete while its output is only a disconnected artifact, fixture, data file, hidden registry, loose doc, or proof file.

- [ ] The changed output is wired into the live route, card, dashboard, tool, analyzer, report, or runtime surface that consumes it.
- [ ] Direct user-visible route/card links are included above when a surface is affected.
- [ ] Runtime or lazy-bundle load order is updated when the new output must execute before another projection.
- [ ] Queue/progress status was changed only after live visibility wiring existed.
- [ ] Tests assert both the data artifact and the live integration path that consumes it.
- [ ] No same-surface gap parking: buildable follow-up work in the same ownership area and live surface was built now, not added as a vague future Product Build item.
- [ ] Evidence ingestion is covered when the item expects pasted terminal output, browser-observation text, or proof notes.
- [ ] Any deferred useful finding has a named blocker, blast-radius reason, missing-source proof, private-only reason, or product-gap ID that explains why it could not be built in this PR.
- [ ] The PR does not claim completion while also saying the same item has `remaining integration`, needs a `later pass`, is `not visible yet`, or is an `additive proof artifact only`.

For re-mining artifacts, run:

```bash
node tools/validate-live-integration-done-gate.js data/product-hardening/<artifact>.js
```

## Tests

```bash

## Safety / source-boundary notes

- Raw course text, target details, flags, credentials, cookies, screenshots, exploit recipes, listener/callback mechanics, and reusable replay steps remain private.
- Public Obol contains only rewritten, generalized, public-safe guidance and product logic.
