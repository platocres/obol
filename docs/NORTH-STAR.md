# Obol North Star Contract

This document owns the detailed project-progress and source-accounting contract. `README.md` keeps the permanent North Star requirements visible at the project entry point; this file explains how those requirements are measured.

## Pinned upstream

Obol models its Active Directory methodology from Orange Cyberdefense 2025.03:

- Pinned AD tree: `51b414fc0c0a1a4414e86986ec5e2b5225a6d698`

The normalized canonical denominator is 127 sections. It measures structural breadth, not whether every useful detail in the source has been exhausted.

## Three separate layers of progress

### Canonical breadth

Canonical breadth answers: **Is each normalized methodology section represented, and how completely?**

States remain implemented, partial, gap, and stale. The denominator stays pinned at 127 unless the pinned canonical snapshot is deliberately revised.

### Source inventory depth

At the v6.2 boundary, the then-34 partial canonical sections were frozen as a persistent source-depth baseline. This prevents a broad parent changing status from making unresolved subordinate source work disappear.

Source inventory asks whether methodology-bearing source files and frozen partial parents have been decomposed into meaningful subordinate units rather than treated as one broad card.

### Atomic source fidelity

Atomic fidelity asks whether each inventoried source unit has been translated through the complete Obol operator contract. A broad owner mapping is not completion.

An atomic unit is fidelity-complete only when the relevant requirements are accounted for, including:

1. source structure;
2. branch conditions;
3. tool inventory;
4. Obol owner mapping;
5. tool suitability review;
6. Run contract and semantic controls;
7. execution context;
8. Evidence and proof boundaries;
9. Next Steps transitions;
10. reporting and lineage;
11. cleanup/restoration where relevant;
12. terminal disposition.

Terminal dispositions are `modeled`, `superseded`, or `rejected`, with rationale. Merely assigning one of those labels without satisfying the required review dimensions is not enough.

## Current v6.9 baseline

v6.9 continues the already-inventoried AD CS source-fidelity queue and reconciles broad canonical parents only after every inventoried subordinate unit beneath them is fidelity-complete:

- canonical: 99 / 127 implemented, 28 partial, 0 gaps, 0 stale;
- strict completion: 78%;
- represented coverage: 100%;
- methodology source files atomized: 1 / 17;
- frozen partial baselines decomposed: 7 / 34;
- inventoried atomic units fidelity-complete: 14 / 19;
- remaining inventoried atomic audits: 5;
- remaining source-inventory/decomposition items: 27.

The two canonical advances in v6.9 are accounting reconciliation, not denominator inflation. `adcs.pki-object-acl` advances because ESC5 is complete. `adcs.ca-misconfig` advances because both inventoried CA-misconfiguration units, ESC6 and ESC11, are complete. The frozen v6.2 baseline remains 34, so broad-parent promotion does not erase source-depth history.

The five remaining inventoried AD CS audits are certificate-mapping units. They remain higher priority than the 27 source-inventory/decomposition items because their missing delivery requirements are already known precisely.

These denominators must remain visible. A percentage may summarize a denominator but must never make unfinished source disappear.

## Build Next ordering

The repository work queue is ordered by product quality, not by whichever metric is easiest to increase:

1. implemented-quality repairs;
2. mapped-delivery repairs;
3. canonical gaps;
4. atomic source-fidelity audits for already-inventoried units;
5. source-depth inventory/decomposition for remaining broad partial baselines.

This ordering is derived from the repository model and exposed through the stable `C.currentProjectModel(...)` pointer. The current versioned implementation is `C.projectModel69(...)`.

## Current-project projection rule

Beginning with v6.6, project status has one current projection boundary. v6.8 added the stable non-versioned pointer `C.currentProjectModel(...)` so current consumers do not need to hard-code whichever versioned adapter happens to be newest. v6.9 keeps that pointer current while retaining versioned adapters as historical regression boundaries.

The Dashboard and README may present or summarize its output, but they should not keep independent current counts or competing Build Next calculations. The underlying domain models remain the owners of canonical, delivery, and source-fidelity semantics; the project model provides a stable current view over them.

Versioned adapters remain useful as historical regression boundaries. They are not an invitation for current tooling or documentation to guess the newest version-specific function name.

## Completion language

Use these distinctions consistently:

- **100% represented** means every normalized canonical section has representation.
- **100% fully implemented** would mean all 127 normalized canonical sections are implemented.
- **Source fully inventoried** would mean every methodology-bearing source file and every frozen source-depth baseline is explicitly decomposed/accounted for.
- **Source fidelity complete** would mean every useful inventoried unit has a complete terminal audit.
- **Orange exhausted of useful ideas** may only be claimed when the source inventory and fidelity work are complete, including explicit superseded/rejected rationales where appropriate.

Canonical breadth is not source exhaustion.

## Product integration requirements

Source work is useful only when it improves Obol as an operator product. Where applicable, modeled paths must connect to sensible command controls, explicit Kali/Windows execution context, conservative Evidence interpretation, Next Steps, cleanup/restoration, lineage, and reporting.

Source accounting is project metadata only. It must never create engagement facts, credentials, access, execution, privilege, or compromise state.
